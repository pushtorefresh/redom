| Observing Changes            | DSL exposes Reactive Observe API                               | DSL exposes listeners-based Observe API                                                                                                                                     |
| Applying Changes             | DOM observes Observable values without need for DSL recreation | DOM does not observe changes to DSL made after rendering, new DSL needs to be applied. Low level components API might be exposed to find and change already rendered views  |
